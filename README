Hi,

To use this, just build it in the usual autoconf-ey way (configure && make)

Then, run src/aurena on one machine, and
'src/client/simple-client' on several clients that can access the
server machine 'server-host'. If that doesn't work (if Avahi broadasts are
broken, pass the server-host name explicitly as a parameter to simple-client).
For control, hit http://server-host:5457/

Notes/future ideas:

*) media library with metadata - see available songs
*) Multiple zones, ability to move players between zones
**) pause zone when 0 players online

- daemon portion - http + rtsp + network clock source
  + avahi announcements
  + base time distribution
  + http = libsoup
  + network clock source = gst
  - rtsp = gst-rtsp-server
- player
  + playbin wrapper that does rtsp or http + network clock subscription
    and follows remote volume control, pause/play etc.


Security
========

Very little effort has been put into making the server secure. It may allow
arbitrary files from the server's file system to be served to clients. No
authentication is required for clients to connect.

This software should only ever be run on a private network, where all software
running on the network and its clients is trusted.
